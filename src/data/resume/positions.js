      'Full time remote during the Corona crisis, I spent 11 weeks with 10 students to create a sustainable aircraft from scratch.',
      'My responsibilities were as head of structures and materials and secretary and we delivered a detailed design, which included planform, power and propulsion, landing gear and the corresponding ground facilities.',
      'The aim was to research the feasibility of liquid hydrogen, blended wing body passenger aircraft, featuring a capacity of 236 pax and a range of 4500km, which is a distance from Norway to Cyprus.',
      'The results were a feasible aircraft design with a 99 % reduction of the total emissions and a recyclability of 90 % by weight. Due to the clever blended wing body design, a great lift-over-drag ratio of 25.68 is achieved, resulting in a range of 4500 km. Finally, by also producing the hydrogen from wind powered PEM electrolysis, the Hydrojet is truly sustainable and flight shame proof.',

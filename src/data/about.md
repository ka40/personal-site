# Currently

Currently looking for an internship that fits my passions and ambitions. My days are at home a lot. Thankfully, I walk my dog 2-3 times a day, so I am forced to stretch my legs. While walking my dog I like to listen to audiobooks, currently listening to 21 Lessons for the 21st Century Yuval Noah Harari, and I resonate with a lot of his ideas about AI. I spend time with my girlfriend watching movies.
